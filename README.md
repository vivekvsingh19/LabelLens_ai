## 🎯 Problem Statement

**70% of consumers don't understand food labels.** Complex ingredient names, hidden additives, and misleading marketing make it nearly impossible for people to make informed food choices. This leads to:

- Unknowingly consuming harmful additives
- Allergic reactions from hidden ingredients
- Poor dietary decisions affecting long-term health
- Difficulty managing conditions like diabetes or hypertension

- ✅ **Safety Score (0-100)** — Instant health rating
- 🚦 **Color-Coded Badges** — Safe (Green), Caution (Yellow), Avoid (Red)
- 🔬 **Ingredient Breakdown** — What each ingredient does and its health impact
- 📊 **Composition Analysis** — Sugar, fat, and additive percentages
- 💡 **Smart Recommendations** — Personalized consume/avoid advice

## 🔬 How It Works

1. **Capture** — User scans a product label using camera or uploads from gallery

2. **Process** — Image is sent to Gemini AI with specialized prompts for ingredient analysis

3. **Analyze** — AI evaluates each ingredient against health databases:
   - Checks for harmful additives (artificial colors, HFCS, BHA/BHT)
   - Calculates sugar and fat percentages
   - Rates each ingredient (Safe/Caution/Avoid)
   - Generates overall safety score

4. **Present** — Results displayed with:
   - Visual safety gauge
   - Color-coded recommendations
   - Detailed ingredient breakdown
   - Actionable health advice

## 📊 Scoring Algorithm

| Factor | Weight | Criteria |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Ingredient Safety | 60% | Harmful additives = major penalty |
| Sugar Content | 25% | >20g/100g = Avoid rating |
| Fat & Overall | 15% | Balanced assessment |

**Automatic Downgrades:**
- Any "avoid" ingredient → Max score 50
- 2+ "caution" ingredients → Max score 65
- Artificial colors → Always "avoid"

---

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- **Clarity First** — Complex data simplified into visual indicators
- **Trust Through Transparency** — Show exactly why each rating is given
- **Accessibility** — Color-coded + text labels for all ratings
- **Delight** — Smooth animations and premium feel

---
